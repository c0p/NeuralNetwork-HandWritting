# NeuralNetwork-HandWritting
scary, scary math was involved. future reference stuff for future skynet machine learning projects

## What this mysterious neural network does:
Gathers 60,000 MNIST digital handwriting images. 50,000 imgs are used for training the neural network and the other 10,000 is used for verifying handwriting. Highest peak of classification is approx. 95% in Epoch 29. Makes mini batches of random training samples and uses stochastic Gradient Design algorithmn to compute bias/weights for each epochs.
